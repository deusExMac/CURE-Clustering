# CURE-Clustering
 An implementation of the CURE (Clustering Using REpresentatives) clustering algorithm in R. 
 
 The implementation of CURE follows the design described in section 7.4.1 (pg 275) of [2] and [3]. CURE allows for oddly shaped clusters.
 
 Folder testdata/ contains csv files to test CURE clustering. Some of the files in testdata/ were downloaded from [4].
